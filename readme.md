# Sourcing the components

If you don't want to source the Elite-C adapter PCB, you can use the [printable shield adapter from Geoff](https://github.com/geoffder/dometyl-keyboard/blob/main/things/holders/bastardkb/printable_shield.stl).

If you don't want to source the flexible PCBs, you can also use either amoebas or handwire.

If you want RGB, you will also need:

| Part name          | Amount    | Format                                |
| ------------------ | --------- | ------------------------------------- |
| SK6812 Mini-E LEDs | 42        |                                       |
| Capacitor, 1uF     | 4         | 1206                                  |
| Resistor, 330Ohms  | 4         | 1206                                  |
| Wires              |           | 28 AWG recommended, Black, Red, Color |
| Ribbon cables      | Flexstrip |                                       |
